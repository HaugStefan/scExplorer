The Nephgen scExplorer
The single-cell explorer "scEplorer" is a searchable database to visualize gene expression from RNA-sequencing.
Its intended use is to make datasets generated within the NephGen Initiative (CRC 1453) findable, accessible and searchable, for all reasearchers within the initiative and to thereby promote scientific collaboration and progress. It allows for downloading of plots, as well as lists of marker genes.
Upon publication the datasets will also be publicly accessible via the scExplorer.
For demonstration, it currently contains data from two published single-cell RNA-seq experiments of human kidney:

    Wu et al:
    Data from 4525 nuclei. Kidney tissue from a single human individual.
    Cell Stem Cell 2018, PMID: 30449713
    Lake et al:
    Data from 17659 nuclei. Kidney tissue from 15 different human individuals.
    Nature Communications 2019 , PMID: 31249312

Please give it a try by loading a dataset and searching for your genes of interest!
